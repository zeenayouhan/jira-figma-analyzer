## Description
Acceptance Criteria

Given the user is on the Profile tab,
When they click the Edit button next to Occupation, Country of Residence,
Then a dropdown should appear allowing them to select from a predefined list (same as used in onboarding).

Given the user selects a value from the Occupation, Country of Residence dropdown,
When the selection is made,
Then the new value should be saved to the database in real time.

Given that a user successfully updates either Occupation or Country of Residence,
When the update completes,
Then a Mixpanel event may be fired to track the change (optional / nice to have).

## Analysis Results

### Suggested Questions (8)
- What is the mechanism for populating the predefined list of options for both Occupation and Country of Residence dropdowns? Are these lists static or dynamic, and how will they be maintained?
- How will the real-time saving of the new value to the database be implemented? Will this involve immediate database updates upon selection or will there be a separate save action?
- What is the expected behavior if a user selects a value but then decides to cancel the edit? Should there be a rollback mechanism for these changes?
- How will the UI indicate to the user that the new value has been successfully saved to the database? Will there be any confirmation message or visual feedback?
- Are there any validation requirements for the values selected in the Occupation and Country of Residence dropdowns? How should invalid selections be handled?
- Will there be any restrictions on the frequency or number of times a user can update their Occupation or Country of Residence within a certain time period?
- How will the Mixpanel event for tracking the changes be integrated into the codebase? What data points should be included in this event for effective tracking?
- Is there a need to handle any edge cases, such as network failures or database connection issues, during the real-time updating process? If so, what are the error handling mechanisms in place?

### Design Questions (12)
- Are there specific UI components in the Advisor Profile, Akiko Profile Image, JP/UserProfile/Profile Details/Partner/noselection, Memi Profile Icon, Memi Profile Picture, or Profile Self-Change screens that can be leveraged for the "Edit" button next to Occupation and Country of Residence?
- How is the dropdown menu designed in the Figma files for selecting Occupation and Country of Residence in the Profile Tab? Is it consistent with the dropdown used during onboarding for a seamless user experience?
- Are there any existing animations or transitions in the Figma file that can be utilized to enhance the dropdown appearance when selecting Occupation or Country of Residence in real time?
- In the Profile Tab screen, are there any specific success button designs that can be repurposed for displaying a confirmation message after updating the Occupation or Country of Residence?
- How is the saving/loading state represented in components like Action Button or Back Button that can be adapted for indicating real-time database updates after selecting a new value for Occupation or Country of Residence?
- Are there any established design patterns in the Figma file for handling user input validation when selecting a value from the dropdown for Occupation or Country of Residence?
- Considering accessibility, do the button components used in the Figma file adhere to accessibility standards (e.g., color contrast, focus states) for users interacting with the "Edit" button and dropdown in the Profile Tab?
- How is user feedback (such as error messages or success indicators) handled in the Figma designs for the Profile Tab when a user makes a selection from the predefined list for Occupation or Country of Residence?
- Are there specific Mixpanel event tracking components or designs in the Figma file that can be incorporated to implement optional event tracking for changes in Occupation or Country of Residence on the user profile?
- How can responsive design considerations be applied to the button and dropdown components in the Profile Tab to ensure a consistent user experience across different screen sizes when editing Occupation and Country of Residence?
- How should the design adapt to different mobile screen sizes?
- What are the touch interaction patterns for mobile implementation?

### Technical Considerations (5)
- Database schema changes may be required
- Consider data migration strategy
- React Native platform-specific implementations
- App store deployment considerations
- High complexity design (Habitto App UI: Sprint Execution) may require additional development time

### Test Cases (25)
- **Functional Tests:**
- - Test 1: Verify that clicking the Edit button next to Occupation on the Profile tab opens a dropdown with predefined occupation options.
- - Expected Outcome: Dropdown with occupation options should appear for selection.
- - Test 2: Confirm that selecting a new Occupation value from the dropdown saves the update to the database in real time.
- - Expected Outcome: New Occupation value should be successfully saved to the database.
- - Test 3: Validate that clicking the Edit button next to Country of Residence on the Profile tab displays a dropdown with predefined country options.
- - Expected Outcome: Dropdown with country options should be shown for selection.
- - Test 4: Ensure that selecting a new Country of Residence value from the dropdown saves the update to the database immediately.
- - Expected Outcome: New Country of Residence value should be saved in real time.
- - Test 5: Test if a Mixpanel event is fired after successfully updating either Occupation or Country of Residence.
- - Expected Outcome: Optional Mixpanel event should be triggered to track the change.
- **Security & Compliance Tests:**
- - Test 6: Verify that user authentication is required before allowing edits to Occupation or Country of Residence.
- - Expected Outcome: Users should be prompted to log in before making any updates.
- - Test 7: Test data protection by ensuring that sensitive user information is securely stored and transmitted during profile updates.

### Risk Areas (4)
- Very complex design (Habitto App UI: Sprint Execution) may exceed estimated effort
- Cross-platform compatibility testing required
- App store approval process may add timeline risk
- Database changes may require careful migration planning
