Enable Editing of “Occupation”, “Country of Residence” on User Profile
Acceptance Criteria

Given the user is on the Profile tab,
When they click the Edit button next to Occupation, Country of Residence,
Then a dropdown should appear allowing them to select from a predefined list (same as used in onboarding).

Given the user selects a value from the Occupation, Country of Residence dropdown,
When the selection is made,
Then the new value should be saved to the database in real time.

Given that a user successfully updates either Occupation or Country of Residence,
When the update completes,
Then a Mixpanel event may be fired to track the change (optional / nice to have).
