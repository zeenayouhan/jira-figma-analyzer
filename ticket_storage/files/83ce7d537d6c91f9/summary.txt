As a verified customer, I can manage/update my personal information
After initial app registration, users should be able to at least read/see a basic profile area with their information in place, and do some basic profile related tasks 



Main sections : 



view user profile information , those verified by KYC will come with a blue check mark 

Switch on and off app push notifications (will likely be a static page with GMOa information)

Documents - links to DatoCMS to retrieve key documents , app terms of use etc

Security - (user is able to toggle on and off biometrics, set up passcode and change the passcode )

Company - key info about Habitto organization, mostly static
