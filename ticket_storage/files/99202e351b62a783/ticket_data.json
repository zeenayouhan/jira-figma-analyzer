  "description": "To initiate our discussions around how we will structure our customer view, here’s a table about some of the key/value pairs that will be absolutely necessary: \n\nKey\n\nFormat\n\nValue\n\nID\n\nAuto-generated\n\n\n\nFull name\n\nText\n\nText string with x max characters.\n\nNickname\n\nText\n\nText string with shorter x max characters.\n\nMobile number\n\nNumber\n\nUsers should use their mobile numbers to sign in.\n\nEmail address\n\nEmail\n\nEmail format validation\n\nDate of birth\n\nDate\n\nDD/MM/YYYY\n\nGender\n\nBoolean\n\nMale Female Not Specified\n\nAddress (array)\n\nArray\n\nHouse number, Block number, Street, District, Ward, City, Prefecture, Postal code.\n\nThere are 47 fixed prefectures in Japan.\n\nPostal codes follow the 〒NNN-NNNN format.\n\nOccupation\n\nText\n\nCompany employee\nCompany director\nAssociation staff member\nAssociation executive\nGovernment employee\nTemporary/Part-time worker\nSelf-employed\nStudent\nHousewife\nUnemployed\nOther\n\nCompany\n\nText\n\nText (might need logic based on answer above)\n\nUsers can be grouped under similar Companies. This will help us figure out group insurance ideas later.\n\nUsers can be related to other Users (mom, dad, siblings). This will help us figure out family units later.\n\nUsers can have one or more Devices. We will need these mobile device IDs in order to figure out push notifications later.\n\nUsers can have one or more Documents, like My Number ID, driving licenses or passport.\n\nFigma Links:\nhttps://www.figma.com/design/fnCxddHpd5tOcjYxzliAxc/Habitto-App-UI--Sprint-Execution?node-id=9867-22967&t=qGOiHRiUvWPBXQC5-0",
