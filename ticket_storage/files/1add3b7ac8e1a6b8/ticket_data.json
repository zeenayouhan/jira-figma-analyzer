  "title": "As chat user, I want to have my typed message automatically saved as a draft",
  "description": "Background:\n\nHabitto’s conversational experience is a key engagement channel between customers and financial advisors. To improve customer support, financial advisors need the ability to guide users more effectively during chats. This involves embedding deeplinks (to navigate to specific screens) or custom app actions (to trigger UI widgets) directly within messages sent via the Twilio Flex/CP.\n\nThis functionality requires seamless coordination between:\n\nTwilio Flex/CP (agent chat interface)\n\nHabitto App frontend (deeplink and widget handling)\n\nRobust handling of deeplink formatting, fallback behavior, and message rendering is crucial for a consistent and helpful user experience.\n\nScope:\n\nEnable advisors to insert predefined or dynamic deeplinks and actions into chat messages.\n\nEnsure the app can interpret and act on these deeplinks or commands reliably.\n\nCreate message templates or UI in Flex to reduce manual formatting for advisors.\n\nSupport both navigation (e.g., to a portfolio screen) and widget triggering (e.g., open an investment calculator).\n\nAcceptance Criteria:\n\nScenario 1: Deeplink\nGiven that an advisor is in a conversation in Twilio Flex,\nWhen they send a message containing a deeplink\nThen the customer’s app should interpret the deeplink and navigate to the specified screen.\n\nScenario 2: Chat action\nGiven that an advisor sends a message with an embedded app action\nWhen the customer receives and taps the message,\nThen the app should open the corresponding widget overlay or component.\n\nScenario 3: Unsupported deeplink  fallback\nGiven that a customer receives a chat message with an unsupported or malformed deeplink,\nWhen they tap it,\nThen the app should fail gracefully and show an informative error message or default to a safe fallback.\n\n\n\nFigma Links:\nhttps://www.figma.com/design/4x1T7IbI3OhtYWr9CH9I7V/Habitto-AI-Assistant---Chat-Revamp?node-id=40-1168&p=f&t=5OB4jl2Qwa6K0MUD-0",
