  "title": "[FE] Enhance the session history screen with a filter",
  "description": "Update the session history screen to allow users to filter their past and upcoming sessions. Currently, all sessions are displayed in one list, making it harder for users to find specific types of sessions. The new filter tabs (すべて / 予約済 / 完了 / キャンセル) will improve usability by letting users view sessions by status (all, reserved, completed, canceled).\n\nDesign\n\n \n\nAcceptance Criteria\n\nFilter Tabs Display\n\nGiven the user is on the session history screen\n\nWhen the screen is displayed\n\nThen the filter tabs “すべて / 予約済 / 完了 / キャンセル” are visible above the session list\n\nDefault State\n\nGiven the user is on the session history screen\n\nWhen the screen is displayed for the first time\n\nThen the “すべて” (All) filter is selected by default and all sessions (予約済, 完了, キャンセル) are shown\n\n予約済 (Reserved) Filter\n\nGiven the user is on the session history screen\n\nWhen the user selects the “予約済” filter\n\nThen only sessions with a reserved status are shown in the list\n\n完了 (Completed) Filter\n\nGiven the user is on the session history screen\n\nWhen the user selects the “完了” filter\n\nThen only sessions with a completed status are shown in the list\n\nキャンセル (Canceled) Filter\n\nGiven the user is on the session history screen\n\nWhen the user selects the “キャンセル” filter\n\nThen only sessions with a canceled status are shown in the list\n\nTab State Change\n\nGiven the user has selected a filter tab\n\nWhen the filter is applied\n\nThen the selected tab is highlighted and remains active until another tab is chosen\n\nNo Sessions for Selected Filter\n\nGiven the user is on the session history screen\n\nWhen the user selects a filter tab with no matching sessions\n\nThen an empty state message is displayed “該当するセッションはありません” and no session cards are shown: https://www.figma.com/design/fnCxddHpd5tOcjYxzliAxc/Habitto-App-UI--Sprint-Execution?node-id=144256-157301&t=w5U3lTdHqW5T6fgg-11 \n\nAll Filters Empty\n\nGiven the user is on the session history screen for the first time\n\nWhen the user has no session history at all\n\nThen the “すべて” filter is selected by default and the empty state message is displayed as implemented already\n\nFilter Persistence on Reselect\n\nGiven the user has selected a filter tab (e.g., “キャンセル”)\n\nWhen the user reopens the session history screen during the same app session\n\nThen the previously selected filter remains active and its corresponding list is shown\n\n\n\nFigma Links:\nhttps://www.figma.com/design/fnCxddHpd5tOcjYxzliAxc/Habitto-App-UI--Sprint-Execution?node-id=144261-157914&t=dZkErYTJGbq9q4H5-0",
