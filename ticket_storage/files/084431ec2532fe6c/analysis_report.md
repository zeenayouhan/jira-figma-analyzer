## Analysis Results

### Suggested Questions (12)
- What authentication method should be used for the onboarding process? (e.g., email/password, social login, biometric)
- Are there any specific security requirements or protocols that need to be followed during the authentication flow implementation?
- Should there be any email verification or account activation steps as part of the authentication flow?
- Is there a specific user data validation process that needs to be integrated during the onboarding/authentication process?
- Are there any specific error handling and messaging requirements for different scenarios during the authentication flow?
- How should the user account be managed and stored once the onboarding process is completed?
- Are there any specific user roles or permissions that need to be defined during the onboarding/authentication process?
- Should there be any multi-factor authentication (MFA) implemented as part of the authentication flow?
- How should the user session management be handled after successful authentication?
- Are there any specific GDPR or data privacy considerations that need to be addressed during the onboarding/authentication process?
- Is there a need for any integration with third-party identity providers (e.g., OAuth, SAML) for authentication purposes?
- How should the UI/UX design support a seamless and intuitive onboarding/authentication experience for users on both mobile and web platforms?

### Design Questions (12)
- In the Biometric Login Flow screen, are there specific interactions or animations planned for the biometric authentication process to enhance user experience?
- For the Author component in the Login Flow screen, is there a specific visual cue or indicator planned to guide users on where to input their credentials?
- How is the Card Delivery Flow screen structured to ensure a seamless transition for users from authentication to accessing their account details?
- Are there any specific accessibility considerations implemented in the JP/FaceAuth component to cater to users with disabilities during the authentication process?
- In the JP/GANB Portal/Login/In-app browser/Daily ATM Limit component, how is the UI designed to display the daily ATM limit information clearly to users within the authentication flow?
- Can you elaborate on how the Daily ATM Limit component functions within the JP/FaceAuth flow to ensure users can easily set and view their limits?
- With the New Basic Profiling Flow for non-Japanese users, are there any language or cultural considerations incorporated in the design to make the onboarding process more inclusive and user-friendly?
- How is the Card Limit Setting component integrated into the JP/FaceAuth flow to enable users to adjust their card limits seamlessly during the authentication process?
- Are there specific UI elements or design patterns used in the Modified: Daily Debit Limit component under JP/FaceAuth to enhance clarity and usability for users managing their daily spending limits?
- How is the design of the New Card Delivery Flow optimized for responsiveness on various screen sizes to ensure a consistent user experience during the onboarding process?
- How should the design adapt to different mobile screen sizes?
- What are the touch interaction patterns for mobile implementation?

### Business Questions (15)

- How will the authentication flow integrate with existing business processes, such as client relationship management and appointment scheduling, to enhance overall efficiency?
- What success metrics and measurement criteria will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of the authentication flow in improving user onboarding and engagement?
- How will the authentication flow feature enhance the overall client experience and satisfaction, leading to increased client retention and loyalty?
- What security measures will be put in place to ensure data protection and privacy for users during the authentication process?
- How will the authentication flow impact the overall user experience and satisfaction, ultimately leading to increased usage and engagement on the platform?
- How can the authentication flow feature be leveraged to upsell additional financial advisory services or products to users during the onboarding process?
- What level of customization and personalization can be achieved through the authentication flow to tailor the user experience to individual client needs and preferences?

### Technical Considerations (5)
- Security review required for authentication/authorization
- Compliance requirements need verification
- React Native platform-specific implementations
- App store deployment considerations
- High complexity design (Habitto App UI: Sprint Execution) may require additional development time

### Test Cases (24)
- **Functional Tests:**
- - Validate the onboarding user feature by registering a new user with valid credentials and verifying successful authentication.
- - Test the user journey by logging in with existing credentials and navigating through the onboarding process smoothly.
- - Verify the integration of the authentication flow with existing financial advisory features, such as account management and portfolio tracking.
- - Validate business rules related to user authentication, such as password complexity requirements and account lockout policies.
- - Test the functionality of setting up financial goals and preferences during the onboarding process.
- - Ensure that the user is prompted to complete necessary information for personalized financial recommendations.
- - Verify that the onboarding process includes an option for users to link external financial accounts for comprehensive financial planning.
- - Test the feature that allows users to schedule appointments with financial advisors through the platform.
- **Security & Compliance Tests:**
- - Validate data protection measures by ensuring that user credentials are securely stored and transmitted.
- - Verify compliance with financial services regulations by checking that user data is encrypted and protected according to industry standards.
- - Test user authentication and authorization mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive financial information.
- - Verify that audit trails are generated for user actions during the onboarding process to maintain a record of user interactions.
- **Performance & Reliability Tests:**
- - Conduct response time testing during the onboarding process to ensure a seamless user experience.
- - Test system stability under stress by simulating a high volume of user registrations and logins.
- - Verify error handling and recovery mechanisms by intentionally inputting incorrect information during the onboarding process.
- - Validate data consistency and integrity by checking that user information is accurately captured and stored.
- **User Experience Tests:**
- - Validate accessibility compliance by testing the onboarding process with assistive technologies to ensure WCAG standards are met.
- - Test cross-browser and device compatibility to ensure a consistent user experience across different platforms.
- - Verify user interface responsiveness by testing the onboarding process on various screen sizes and resolutions.
- - Test error message clarity and helpfulness by intentionally triggering errors during the onboarding process and verifying the clarity of error messages displayed to the user.

### Risk Areas (4)
- Very complex design (Habitto App UI: Sprint Execution) may exceed estimated effort
- Security review and compliance verification required
- Cross-platform compatibility testing required
- App store approval process may add timeline risk
