  "title": "Enable Editing of “Occupation”, “Country of Residence” on User Profile",
  "description": "Acceptance Criteria\n\nGiven the user is on the Profile tab,\nWhen they click the Edit button next to Occupation, Country of Residence,\nThen a dropdown should appear allowing them to select from a predefined list (same as used in onboarding).\n\nGiven the user selects a value from the Occupation, Country of Residence dropdown,\nWhen the selection is made,\nThen the new value should be saved to the database in real time.\n\nGiven that a user successfully updates either Occupation or Country of Residence,\nWhen the update completes,\nThen a Mixpanel event may be fired to track the change (optional / nice to have).\n\n\n\nFigma Links:\nhttps://www.figma.com/design/fnCxddHpd5tOcjYxzliAxc/Habitto-App-UI--Sprint-Execution?node-id=137944-173127&t=Of2QjnqfzapaSzR4-0",

    "How should the real-time saving to the database be implemented? Are there any specific backend endpoints or database tables that need to be updated?",
    "Are there any validation checks required when a user selects a value from the dropdowns? For example, should the selected value be unique, or should it meet certain criteria?",
    "How should the Mixpanel event be integrated into the system to track the changes in Occupation or Country of Residence? What data should be included in this event?",
