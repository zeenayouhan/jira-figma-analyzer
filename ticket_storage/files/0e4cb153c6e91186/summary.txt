[FE] Enhance the session history screen with a filter
Update the session history screen to allow users to filter their past and upcoming sessions. Currently, all sessions are displayed in one list, making it harder for users to find specific types of sessions. The new filter tabs (すべて / 予約済 / 完了 / キャンセル) will improve usability by letting users view sessions by status (all, reserved, completed, canceled).

Acceptance Criteria

Filter Tabs Display

Given the user is on the session history screen

When the screen is displayed

Then the filter tabs “すべて / 予約済 / 完了 / キャンセル” are visible above the session list

Default State

Given the user is on the session history screen

When the screen is displayed for the first time

Then the “すべて” (All) filter is selected by default and all sessions (予約済, 完了, キャンセル) are shown

予約済 (Reserved) Filter

Given the user is on the session history screen

When the user selects the “予約済” filter

Then only sessions with a reserved status are shown in the list

完了 (Completed) Filter

Given the user is on the session history screen

When the user selects the “完了” filter

Then only sessions with a completed status are shown in the list

キャンセル (Canceled) Filter

Given the user is on the session history screen

When the user selects the “キャンセル” filter

Then only sessions with a canceled status are shown in the list

Tab State Change

Given the user has selected a filter tab

When the filter is applied

Then the selected tab is highlighted and remains active until another tab is chosen

No Sessions for Selected Filter

Given the user is on the session history screen

When the user selects a filter tab with no matching sessions

Then an empty state message is displayed “該当するセッションはありません” and no session cards are shown: https://www.figma.com/design/fnCxddHpd5tOcjYxzliAxc/Habitto-App-UI--Sprint-Execution?node-id=144256-157301&t=w5U3lTdHqW5T6fgg-11 

All Filters Empty

Given the user is on the session history screen for the first time

When the user has no session history at all

Then the “すべて” filter is selected by default and the empty state message is displayed as implemented already

Filter Persistence on Reselect

Given the user has selected a filter tab (e.g., “キャンセル”)

When the user reopens the session history screen during the same app session

Then the previously selected filter remains active and its corresponding list is shown
