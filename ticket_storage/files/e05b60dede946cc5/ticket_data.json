  "title": "[FE] Implement a pre-session survey for the investment session",
  "description": "Implement the pre-session survey flow for the investment session in the app. The survey will guide users through a set of questions to capture their financial goals and investment preferences before their advisory session. \n\n\n\nThe flow includes\n\nUpdated session booking confirmation screen or updated session screen in the pre-survey state on the advisor tab\n\nMultiple question screens (single and multiple-choice)\n\nConfirmation screen after completion\n\nUpdated session screen in the post-survey state on the advisor tab\n\n\n\nDesign\n\nPlease check the design on the prototype mode to check the detailed flow and behavior\n\n\n\nACs\n\nSession Booking Confirmation Screen\n\nNew design:\n\nConfirmation details visible\n\nGiven the user is on the Session Booking Confirmation screen for the investment session\n\nWhen the screen is displayed\n\nThen the updated design shows the CTA to the investment survey along with the new description.\n\nSurvey entry point shown\n\nGiven the user is on the Session Booking Confirmation screen for the investment session\n\nWhen they tap the CTA to the survey\n\nThen the app navigates the user to the first survey question screen\n\nAnswer survey later button\n\nGiven the user is on the Session Booking Confirmation screen for the investment session\n\nWhen the screen is displayed\n\nThen the screen shows an “Answer survey later” button which navigates the user to the Session Home Screen on the Advisor Tab\n\nSession Home Screen on the Advisor Tab\n\nNew designs: \n\nSurvey not started yet (Pre-survey state)\n\nGiven the user is on the Session Home Screen on the Advisor Tab before completing the survey\n\nWhen the screen is displayed\n\nThen the updated design highlights that the survey has not been completed and provides a new title, description, and CTA to begin the survey.\n\nSurvey completion acknowledged without CTA (Post-survey state)\n\nGiven the user is on the Session Home Screen on the Advisor Tab after submitting the survey\n\nWhen the screen is displayed\n\nThen the updated design shows the survey as completed with a confirmation message.\n\nAnd  there is no CTA to start the survey, and the UI instead shows the completed status.\n\nQuestion Screens – Core Behavior\n\nAll questions are multiple-choice and required\n\nCTA button state\n\nGiven the user is on any question screen\n\nWhen no answer is selected\n\nThen the “次へ” button remains inactive until an answer is selected.\n\nCTA button active state\n\nGiven the user is on any question screen with at least one valid selection (or valid free-text entry when “その他” is chosen)\n\nWhen the screen is displayed\n\nThen the “次へ” button becomes active and tappable.\n\nFree-text input (その他 option)\n\nGiven the user is on a question screen with a “その他” (Other) option\n\nWhen they select the “その他” option\n\nThen a free-text field appears for input.\n\nFree-text input validation\n\nGiven the user has selected the “その他” option\n\nWhen no text is entered in the free-text field\n\nThen the “次へ” button remains inactive until text is filled.\n\nProgress indicator\n\nGiven the user is on any question screen\n\nWhen the screen renders\n\nThen a progress indicator shows the current step out of total steps.\n\nProgress indicator animation\n\nGiven the user moves to the next question\n\nWhen the progress indicator updates\n\nThen a glitter animation plays as implemented in the LP pre-session survey.\n\nClose button tapped – confirmation popup\n\nGiven the user is on any question screen\n\nWhen they tap the close (✕) button\n\nThen the app shows the confirmation popup “このままページを閉じてもよろしいですか？” as implemented on the post-session survey by Rishan.\n\nDiscard confirmation – stay on page\n\nGiven the confirmation popup is shown\n\nWhen the user taps “記入に戻る” (Return to editing)\n\nThen the popup closes and the user remains on the same question screen with answers intact.\n\nDiscard confirmation – exit survey\n\nGiven the confirmation popup is shown\n\nWhen the user taps “保存せずに閉じる” (Close without saving)\n\nThen the survey closes and all answers are discarded.\n\nBack navigation within survey\n\nGiven the user is on any question screen except the first\n\nWhen they tap the back arrow\n\nThen the previous question loads with their prior selections restored.\n\nNo auto-save or resume function\n\nGiven the user exits the survey before completion\n\nWhen they reopen it later\n\nThen no answers are restored and the survey restarts from the beginning.\n\nCompletion & Handoff\n\nCompletion screen\n\nGiven the user has answered the final question\n\nWhen they tap “アンケートを提出する”\n\nThen a Survey Complete screen appears confirming submission.\n\nReturn to advisory session\n\nGiven the user is on the Survey Complete screen\n\nWhen they tap the CTA button “閉じる”\n\nThen the app returns to the advisory session screen and marks the pre-session survey as completed for that session.\n\nErrors, Localization, Accessibility, Analytics\n\nNetwork error while submitting\n\nGiven the user is on the final question and taps “アンケートを提出する”\n\nWhen submission fails due to a network error\n\nThen the app displays an error screen: https://www.figma.com/design/fnCxddHpd5tOcjYxzliAxc/Habitto-App-UI--Sprint-Execution?node-id=144252-153026&t=w5U3lTdHqW5T6fgg-11\n\n\n\nFigma
