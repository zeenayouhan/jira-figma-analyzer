### Technical Considerations (2)
- Security review required for authentication/authorization
- Compliance requirements need verification

### Test Cases (24)
- **Functional Tests:**
- 1. Test the user sign up process by entering valid credentials and verifying successful account creation.
- 2. Validate the authentication flow by checking if users receive a verification email after signing up.
- 3. Test the integration with existing financial advisory features by verifying the user's profile information is correctly displayed after sign up.
- 4. Verify that the business rules related to user registration, such as password complexity requirements, are enforced during the sign-up process.
- 5. Test the functionality of updating user information after sign up, ensuring that changes are reflected accurately in the system.
- 6. Validate the ability to schedule an appointment immediately after sign up and confirm that the appointment is successfully booked.
- 7. Test the user journey by signing up, scheduling an appointment, and updating profile information to ensure a seamless experience.
- 8. Verify that users can register with an advisor during the sign-up process and that the advisor is correctly assigned to the user's profile.
- **Security & Compliance Tests:**
- 1. Test the data protection measures by verifying that sensitive user information is securely stored and encrypted.
- 2. Validate compliance with financial services regulations by ensuring that user data is handled in accordance with industry standards.
- 3. Test user authentication and authorization by verifying that only registered users can access the platform's features.
- 4. Verify the audit trail and logging functionality by checking if user actions are logged and can be traced back for security purposes.
- **Performance & Reliability Tests:**
- 1. Perform load testing by simulating a high volume of sign-up requests to evaluate the system's response time and scalability.
- 2. Test the system's stability under stress by signing up multiple users simultaneously and monitoring for any performance issues.
- 3. Validate error handling and recovery by intentionally entering incorrect information during sign up and verifying that appropriate error messages are displayed.
- 4. Verify data consistency and integrity by checking that user information remains accurate and up-to-date after sign up and profile updates.
- **User Experience Tests:**
- 1. Test accessibility compliance by using assistive technologies to navigate the sign-up process and ensuring that all features are accessible.
- 2. Validate cross-browser and device compatibility by signing up on different browsers and devices to ensure a consistent user experience.
- 3. Test user interface responsiveness by checking the platform's performance on various screen sizes and resolutions.
- 4. Verify the clarity and helpfulness of error messages by intentionally triggering errors during sign up and ensuring that users are guided on how to resolve them.

### Risk Areas (1)
