  "title": "Enable Editing of “Occupation”, “Country of Residence” on User Profile",
  "description": "Acceptance Criteria\n\nGiven the user is on the Profile tab,\nWhen they click the Edit button next to Occupation, Country of Residence,\nThen a dropdown should appear allowing them to select from a predefined list (same as used in onboarding).\n\nGiven the user selects a value from the Occupation, Country of Residence dropdown,\nWhen the selection is made,\nThen the new value should be saved to the database in real time.\n\nGiven that a user successfully updates either Occupation or Country of Residence,\nWhen the update completes,\nThen a Mixpanel event may be fired to track the change (optional / nice to have).\n\n\n\nFigma Links:\nhttps://www.figma.com/design/fnCxddHpd5tOcjYxzliAxc/Habitto-App-UI--Sprint-Execution?node-id=137944-173127&t=Of2QjnqfzapaSzR4-0",
