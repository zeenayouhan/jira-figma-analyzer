  "suggested_questions": [
    "How should the completion of an advisory session be tracked within the app? Is there a specific flag or status that is updated upon session completion?",
    "Does the native app rating prompt need to appear immediately upon returning to the Sessions screen, or is there a delay or condition for its display?",
    "What specific criteria trigger the appearance of the native app rating prompt? Is it based on the number of completed sessions, a specific type of advisory session, or other factors?",
    "Are there any specific requirements or restrictions for the app rating prompt, such as minimum rating value, custom message, or redirection after rating submission?",
