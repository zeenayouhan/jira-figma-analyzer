### Technical Considerations (3)
- React Native platform-specific implementations
- App store deployment considerations
- High complexity design (Habitto App UI: Sprint Execution) may require additional development time

### Test Cases (24)
- **Functional Tests:**
- - Validate that users can successfully sign up for the financial advisory platform by providing necessary personal information such as name, email, and password.
- - Test the user journey from the sign-up page to the confirmation screen to ensure a seamless experience.
- - Verify that the sign-up process integrates smoothly with existing financial advisory features such as account creation and portfolio management.
- - Validate that business rules from the knowledge base, such as minimum password requirements, are enforced during the sign-up process.
- - Test the ability to link external accounts during the sign-up process for easy integration with financial data.
- - Verify that users receive a confirmation email after signing up to validate their account.
- - Test the functionality of the email verification link to ensure successful account activation.
- - Validate that users are redirected to their dashboard after completing the sign-up process.
- **Security & Compliance Tests:**
- - Validate that user data is encrypted during the sign-up process to protect privacy.
- - Test compliance with financial services regulations by ensuring that all required information is collected during sign-up.
- - Verify that user authentication and authorization protocols are in place to protect user accounts.
- - Test the audit trail functionality to ensure that all sign-up activities are logged for compliance purposes.
- **Performance & Reliability Tests:**
- - Conduct load testing to ensure the platform can handle a high volume of sign-up requests without crashing.
- - Test the system's stability under stress by simulating multiple sign-up attempts simultaneously.
- - Verify error handling and recovery mechanisms by purposely entering incorrect information during the sign-up process.
- - Validate data consistency and integrity by checking that all user information is accurately captured and stored in the database.
- **User Experience Tests:**
- - Test for accessibility compliance by checking that the sign-up page meets WCAG standards for users with disabilities.
- - Validate cross-browser and device compatibility by testing the sign-up process on different browsers and devices.
- - Test user interface responsiveness by checking that all elements on the sign-up page load quickly and interact smoothly.
- - Verify that error messages during the sign-up process are clear, concise, and provide helpful guidance for users.

### Risk Areas (3)
- Very complex design (Habitto App UI: Sprint Execution) may exceed estimated effort
- Cross-platform compatibility testing required
- App store approval process may add timeline risk
