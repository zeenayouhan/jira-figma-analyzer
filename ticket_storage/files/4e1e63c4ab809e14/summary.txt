[POC] Implement Chat interface using Flyer chat and Twilio conversation payload
Develop a proof of concept (POC) chat interface by integrating the open-source Flyer Chat UI library (GitHub repo) with Twilio Conversations message payloads. This interface will simulate a basic Habitto-style conversation using mock data from Twilio's SDK, without requiring live integration.

This POC aims to evaluate the feasibility of using Flyer Chat for rendering conversation threads and how well it can display Twilio-based message payloads, including sender info, message types, timestamps, images and attachments (if applicable).

Scope:

Build a lightweight React Native app/sandbox with the Flyer Chat UI.

Load mocked Twilio Conversation payloads to simulate one or more user-bot conversations.

Ensure messages appear in correct order with appropriate timestamps.

Use hardcoded or JSON mock data to simulate different message types (e.g., text, system messages, maybe attachments).

Do not connect to Twilio backend â€” local rendering only.

Make UI theming match Habitto's visual style as closely as possible.
