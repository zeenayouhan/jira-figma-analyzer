  "title": "[POC] Implement Chat interface using Flyer chat and Twilio conversation payload",
  "description": "Develop a proof of concept (POC) chat interface by integrating the open-source Flyer Chat UI library (GitHub repo) with Twilio Conversations message payloads. This interface will simulate a basic Habitto-style conversation using mock data from Twilio's SDK, without requiring live integration.\n\nThis POC aims to evaluate the feasibility of using Flyer Chat for rendering conversation threads and how well it can display Twilio-based message payloads, including sender info, message types, timestamps, images and attachments (if applicable).\n\nScope:\n\nBuild a lightweight React Native app/sandbox with the Flyer Chat UI.\n\nLoad mocked Twilio Conversation payloads to simulate one or more user-bot conversations.\n\nEnsure messages appear in correct order with appropriate timestamps.\n\nUse hardcoded or JSON mock data to simulate different message types (e.g., text, system messages, maybe attachments).\n\nDo not connect to Twilio backend â€” local rendering only.\n\nMake UI theming match Habitto's visual style as closely as possible.\n\n\n\nFigma Links:\nhttps://www.figma.com/design/4x1T7IbI3OhtYWr9CH9I7V/Habitto-AI-Assistant---Chat-Revamp?node-id=40-1168&p=f&t=5OB4jl2Qwa6K0MUD-0",
