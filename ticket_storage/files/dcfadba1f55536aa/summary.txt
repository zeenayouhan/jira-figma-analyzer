Improve Keyboard Closure Animation and Input Bar Behavior
The current behavior of the keyboard closure lacks smoothness, particularly noticeable when the keyboard is closed after input. Additionally, the input bar does not shrink to a single line upon tapping on the screen, deviating from the desired behavior outlined in the reference. This ticket aims to address these issues, ensuring a smoother keyboard closure animation and consistent input bar behavior in alignment with the provided reference.

Acceptance criteria

Current App #2.0.9

Reference

Given a user is interacting with the messaging interface,
When the user inputs text and initiates keyboard closure,
Then the keyboard closure animation should execute smoothly and seamlessly, devoid of any abrupt transitions.

Given the messaging interface is active and displaying the input bar,
When the user taps on any area outside the input field,
Then the input bar should gracefully contract to a single line, aligning with the expected behavior documented in the provided reference.

Given a user is engaged with the messaging feature,
When the user taps anywhere outside the input field,
Then the input bar should animate its reduction to a single line, ensuring a cohesive and intuitive user interaction flow
