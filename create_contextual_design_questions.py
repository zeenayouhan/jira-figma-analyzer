IMPORTANT: Focus ONLY on design elements that are directly related to the ticket requirements. If the ticket is about a specific feature (like rating prompt, login, payment), ask questions ONLY about those specific components and flows.

Focus on:
- Specific screens and components mentioned in the design that relate to the ticket
- User flows and interactions relevant to the ticket feature
- Implementation details for the actual UI elements needed for this ticket
- Design system consistency questions for the specific feature
- Accessibility and responsive design for the specific components being built

Generate 5-8 highly specific questions that reference ONLY the design elements directly related to this ticket's requirements. 

IMPORTANT RULES:
1. ONLY ask about screens/components that are directly related to the ticket (e.g., profile editing, user settings, form fields)
2. DO NOT ask about unrelated screens like registration, onboarding, chat, or other features
3. Focus on the specific functionality mentioned in the ticket
