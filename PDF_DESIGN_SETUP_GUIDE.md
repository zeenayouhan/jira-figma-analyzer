# 📄 PDF Design Analysis Setup Guide

## 🎯 **Overview**

Your Jira-Figma Analyzer now supports **PDF design file analysis**! Instead of (or in addition to) Figma URLs, you can now upload PDF files containing:

- 🖼️ **Wireframes** - Low-fidelity design sketches
- 🎨 **Mockups** - High-fidelity design prototypes
- 📋 **Design Documentation** - Requirements and specifications
- 🖨️ **Figma Exports** - PDF exports from Figma designs
- ✏️ **Hand-drawn Sketches** - Scanned design concepts

## 🔧 **What Gets Analyzed**

### **📊 Content Extraction**

- **Text Content**: All text elements with positioning
- **Images**: Visual design elements and mockups
- **Page Structure**: Multi-page design flows
- **Design Notes**: Annotations and requirements

### **🧩 Design Elements Detection**

- **Screens**: Login, Dashboard, Profile, Settings, etc.
- **UI Components**: Buttons, Forms, Cards, Modals, etc.
- **User Flows**: Sequential screens and navigation paths
- **Requirements**: "Must have", "Should have" statements

### **🎨 Design Type Classification**

- **Wireframes**: Low-fidelity structural layouts
- **Mockups**: High-fidelity visual designs
- **Mixed**: Both wireframes and mockups
- **Documentation**: Text-heavy specification documents

### **⚡ Analysis Outputs**

- **Complexity Score**: 0-10 based on elements and screens
- **Implementation Notes**: Technical guidance for developers
- **Accessibility Considerations**: WCAG compliance recommendations
- **Screen Flow Analysis**: Navigation and user journey insights

## 📱 **How to Use**

### **1. Access the Tool**

```bash
# Make sure the app is running
curl -s http://localhost:8502/ | head -1
# Should return HTML indicating the app is running
```

### **2. Upload PDF Designs**

1. **Go to** `http://localhost:8502`
2. **Navigate to** "🎯 Analyze Tickets" tab
3. **Fill in ticket details** (title, description, etc.)
4. **Scroll to** "📄 **PDF Design Files**" section
5. **Click** "Choose files" and select your PDF(s)
6. **Click** "Analyze Ticket"

### **3. Review Enhanced Analysis**

The tool will now generate questions based on:

- **Actual design content** from your PDFs
- **Screen names** found in the designs
- **UI components** mentioned in the PDFs
- **Design complexity** and implementation effort
- **Confluence knowledge base** context
- **Business requirements** specific to your domain

## 🎯 **Example Analysis**

### **Before (Text Only)**

```
Ticket: "Create mobile banking dashboard"
↓
Questions:
- What are the UI requirements for this feature?
- How should the dashboard be designed?
- What data should be displayed?
```

### **After (PDF Design Analysis)**

```
Ticket: "Create mobile banking dashboard"
+ PDF: mobile-dashboard-wireframes.pdf
↓
Analysis:
- PDF Type: Wireframes (3 pages)
- Screens: ["Login Screen", "Dashboard Screen", "Portfolio Screen"]
- Components: ["Button", "Card", "Chart", "Header"]
- Complexity: 6.2/10
- Requirements: ["Must support portfolio overview", "Should include quick actions"]
↓
Enhanced Questions:
- The wireframe shows a "Portfolio Screen" with chart components - which financial data visualization library should we use?
- Page 2 shows a "Quick Actions" card component - what specific advisor actions should be included?
- The design has a complexity score of 6.2/10 with 3 screens - should we implement in phases?
- The wireframes need visual design - do we have brand guidelines for the chart styling?
- The PDF mentions "must support portfolio overview" - what's the data refresh frequency requirement?
```

## 📋 **Supported PDF Types**

### **✅ What Works Best**

- **Text-based PDFs** - Created from design tools
- **Figma Exports** - PDF exports from Figma
- **Design Documentation** - Requirements with annotations
- **Wireframe Tools** - Balsamiq, Sketch, Adobe XD exports
- **Mixed Content** - Text + images + annotations

### **⚠️ Limitations**

- **Scanned Images** - Pure image PDFs have limited text extraction
- **Complex Graphics** - Heavy visual content may need manual review
- **Handwriting** - Hand-drawn sketches need OCR (optional install)
- **Large Files** - Very large PDFs may take longer to process

## 🔧 **Optional: Enhanced OCR**

For better text extraction from image-heavy PDFs:

```bash
# Install Tesseract OCR (macOS)
brew install tesseract

# Install Python OCR library
source venv/bin/activate
pip install pytesseract

# Restart the app
pkill -f streamlit
streamlit run enhanced_streamlit_app.py --server.port 8502
```

## 🎨 **Best Practices**

### **📝 PDF Preparation**

1. **Add Text Annotations** - Include component names and notes
2. **Use Clear Titles** - Name screens and sections clearly
3. **Include Requirements** - Add "must have" and "should have" notes
4. **Multi-page Flows** - Show screen sequences across pages

### **🎯 Optimal PDF Content**

```
Good PDF Structure:
Page 1: Login Screen
- Components: Email Input, Password Field, Login Button
- Notes: Must validate email format
- Flow: Goes to Dashboard on success

Page 2: Dashboard Screen
- Components: Header, Navigation, Portfolio Card, Quick Actions
- Requirements: Should refresh every 30 seconds
- Layout: Mobile-first responsive design
```

### **📊 Analysis Tips**

- **Upload Multiple PDFs** - Different design phases or flows
- **Combine with Figma** - Use both PDF wireframes and Figma prototypes
- **Add Context** - Include PDF requirements in ticket description
- **Review Suggestions** - Check generated questions for accuracy

## 🚨 **Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

**❌ "PDF processing libraries not available"**

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install PyMuPDF PyPDF2 pillow
```

**❌ "No text extracted from PDF"**

- PDF might be image-based - try OCR install
- Check if PDF has selectable text
- Consider re-exporting from design tool

**❌ "No design elements detected"**

- Add more descriptive text to PDF
- Include component names and screen titles
- Use keywords like "screen", "button", "form"

**❌ Upload fails or timeout**

- Check PDF file size (< 50MB recommended)
- Ensure PDF is not corrupted
- Try uploading one PDF at a time

## 📈 **Analysis Quality Tips**

### **🎯 For Better Detection**

Include these keywords in your PDFs:

- **Screens**: login, dashboard, profile, settings, overview
- **Components**: button, input, field, card, modal, menu
- **Flows**: step 1, next, then, workflow, journey
- **Requirements**: must, should, required, needed
