  "content": "A Fresh Voice for Money Habits: The Thinking Behind the Names\n🧠 Overview: A Human, Playful, and Culturally Fluent Voice\nThe new names reflect a deeply user-centric, culturally nuanced, and brand-aligned voice.\nRather than offering literal translations of financial actions, they tap into emotional resonance,\nhumor, gamification, and everyday language — making abstract or intimidating topics (like\ninsurance or investing) feel friendly, attainable, and even fun.\nThis tone is:\n🗣 Conversational — Sounds like a friend or senpai talking to you.\n🎮 Gamified — Echoes RPG-style level-ups or internet subcultures.\n😄 Playful & Unexpected — Uses nicknames, wordplay, and gentle humor.\n📌 Culturally Specific — Resonates with how Japanese people talk about money without\nsounding like a bank.\n✳ Category Name Choices: Meaning & Nuance\n1. コツコツクラブ  (Kotsukotsu Club) — for \"Grow my savings\"\nKotsukotsu = onomatopoeia for steady, small effort over time — a very Japanese concept of\nperseverance.\nSounds friendly and lighthearted, like a casual club you join with friends.\nImplies that you donʼt need to be perfect or rich to start saving — just consistent.\n🗣 Feels like: “This is a chill club for people who save bit by bit. Youʼre not\nalone.”\n2. デビットの美学  (The Aesthetics of Debit) — for \"Spend wisely\"\nA bold and elegant phrasing. “〇〇の美学 ” is often used in books and media to describe a\nphilosophy or aesthetic way of living (e.g., \" 侍の美学 ”).\nElevates the act of using a debit card into a lifestyle or choice of values.\nSuggests that there's beauty in financial simplicity and control.\n🎨 Feels like: “Thereʼs a kind of coolness and style in using debit wisely.”\n3. 人生プラン設計室  (Life Planning Design Room) — for \"Check my money situation\"\nMimics the name of a real-life consultation office or creative design studio.\n“設計室” (Design Room) makes financial planning feel less corporate and more personalized\nor aspirational.\nImplies co-creation — not something done to you, but with you.\n🏠 Feels like: “This is your space to design your future life plan — and weʼre\nhere to help.”\n4. ディフェンス強化  (Strengthen Your Defense) — for \"Get me the right protection\"\nVery direct and slightly gamified — echoes video game language (“defense stat up!”).\nMakes insurance feel like leveling up your armor, not just boring paperwork.\nAppeals especially to younger users who may be disengaged from the topic.\n🛡 Feels like: “Letʼs power up your safety — just in case life throws a\ncurveball.”\n5. 投資力MAX 化  (Maximize Your Investment Power) — for \"Optimize investment\"\nSounds like a game buff or anime-style power-up (“MAX 化 ” = maxing out).\nInstead of talking about performance or returns, itʼs about empowering the user.\nHigh-energy, playful, and goal-oriented.\n💥 Feels like: “Letʼs crank your investment power to the max — like a pro.”\n🧩 Milestone Names & Micro-Stories (Full List – All 18)\nEach milestone name is crafted like a nickname, slogan, or gentle tease that a friend or senpai\nmight give you when youʼve done something money-smart.
