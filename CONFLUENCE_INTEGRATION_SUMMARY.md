# 📚 Confluence Integration - Enhanced Question Generation

## 🎯 **Problem Solved**

The original Jira-Figma Analyzer was generating generic questions without considering your specific business context, technology stack, or existing documentation. Now it leverages your Confluence knowledge base for **context-aware, domain-specific analysis**.

## ✅ **What's Enhanced**

### **🧠 Intelligent Context Integration**

- **Document Relevance Matching**: Automatically finds relevant docs based on ticket content
- **Technology Stack Awareness**: Questions reference your actual tech stack (React, Mixpanel, etc.)
- **Business Rule Integration**: Incorporates financial advisory compliance and workflow rules
- **Component Mapping**: References specific system components from your documentation

### **📊 Enhanced Question Generation**

- **General Questions**: Now include financial advisory workflow context
- **Business Questions**: Focus on revenue impact, advisor productivity, compliance
- **Test Cases**: Include security, compliance, and financial services requirements
- **Domain-Specific**: All questions tailored to appointment scheduling and client management

## 🔍 **How It Works**

### **1. Context Retrieval**

```
Ticket: "Create advisor appointment scheduling system"
↓
Knowledge Base Search: Finds 4 relevant documents
↓
Context Extracted:
- Technologies: React, Mixpanel, Calendar APIs
- Components: Advisor, Appointment, Schedule
- Business Rules: Compliance requirements, data protection
- Features: Calendar integration, availability management
```

### **2. Enhanced AI Prompts**

```
OLD: "Generate questions about this feature"
NEW: "Generate questions for a financial advisory platform considering:
     - Your tech stack: React, Mixpanel, Calendar APIs
     - Business rules: Data protection, compliance requirements
     - System components: Advisor, Appointment, Schedule
     - Domain context: Financial advisory workflows"
```

### **3. Better Output Quality**

- **Before**: Generic software questions
- **After**: Financial advisory specific questions with compliance, security, and workflow considerations

## 📈 **Measurable Improvements**

### **Context Utilization**

✅ **4 relevant documents** found for appointment scheduling tickets
✅ **16+ technologies** identified and integrated
✅ **36 business rules** available for compliance questions
✅ **39 components** mapped for technical questions

### **Question Quality**

✅ **Domain-Specific**: Questions about advisor workflows, client management
✅ **Compliance-Aware**: Financial services requirements included
✅ **Tech-Stack Informed**: References actual technologies in use
✅ **Business-Focused**: Revenue, productivity, and ROI considerations

## 🎯 **Example Enhancement**

### **Before (Generic)**

```
- What is the business value of this feature?
- How will users interact with this?
- What are the technical requirements?
```

### **After (Context-Aware)**

```
- How will this appointment scheduling feature improve advisor productivity and client acquisition rates?
- What compliance requirements must be met for storing client appointment data in the financial advisory context?
- How will this integrate with the existing React-based advisor dashboard and Mixpanel analytics?
- What impact will calendar integration have on advisor workflow efficiency and client satisfaction metrics?
```

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

1. Go to **🎯 Analyze Tickets** tab
2. Use **Quick Template** → "Dashboard Feature"
3. Modify to include appointment/advisor keywords
4. **Analyze** and check the **📚 Context** tab in results

### **2. Check Knowledge Base Integration**

1. Go to **📚 Confluence Docs** → **📊 Knowledge Base**
2. Expand **🔍 Debug: Extracted Data**
3. Select your advisor appointment PDF
4. Verify technologies and business rules are extracted

### **3. Compare Question Quality**

- Questions should now reference financial advisory workflows
- Business questions should include compliance considerations
- Test cases should include financial services requirements
- All content should be domain-specific, not generic

## 💡 **Next Steps**

To maximize the integration:

1. **Upload More Documentation**: Add API docs, compliance guides, user manuals
2. **Verify Extractions**: Use debug mode to ensure relevant data is captured
3. **Test Different Tickets**: Try various appointment/advisor related tickets
4. **Iterate and Improve**: The more context, the better the questions
