## üéØ Problem Statement

### The MOST BOTHERING Issue Every Sprint

**"What questions should I ask the client?"** and **"What test cases should I write?"**

Every sprint, developers, QA engineers, and product managers spend **2-3 hours per ticket** manually:
- Brainstorming questions to ask clients
- Writing comprehensive test cases
- Identifying risk areas and technical considerations
- Ensuring nothing is missed in requirements analysis

This manual process is:
- ‚ùå **Time-consuming** (2-3 hours per ticket)
- ‚ùå **Inconsistent** (different approaches across team members)
- ‚ùå **Error-prone** (easy to miss important aspects)
- ‚ùå **Not scalable** (quality degrades with time pressure)
- ‚ùå **Context-dependent** (requires deep knowledge of each feature type)

**Impact:** This bottleneck slows down sprint planning, delays development, and reduces team productivity by 15-20% every sprint.
